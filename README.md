## 🌐 Web Application Development Lab

This repository documents my learning journey in web development through:

- College lab exercises  
- Practice projects and UI experiments  
- Step-by-step improvement in frontend and web fundamentals  

The focus of this repo is not just completing labs, but:
- understanding how web apps are built,
- improving code structure and UI thinking,
- and developing real-world development habits.

This is part of my **learn-in-public** approach
